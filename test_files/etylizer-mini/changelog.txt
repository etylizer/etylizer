Document all changes necessary to get the source code working
=============================================================

- overlays for imprecise list functions

- trans_fun_clause, trans_if_clause, trans_record_field has redundant branch
- src/ast_lib mk_union mk_intersection branch removed
- records.erl branch does not match, removed
- fixed utils:quit specs
