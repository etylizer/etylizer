Document all changes necessary to get the source code working
=============================================================

- explicitly specify record arguments that have default values (we do not have support for
  default values) #200
- add some type annotations to stdtypes, otherwise definitions cannot be used from other modules
- fix map_opt/3, it's type was not correct.
- overlays for several functions using binary
- overlay for erlang:element/2
- spec for utils:mingle/5 and utils:is_same_file (we have to ignore these functions because
  of missing support for binary)
- Logging: two parameters instead of all in one list. See commit
  ff9c856c8db724682237c4f99265d3f21f7eee37
- Replace list comprehension with lists:map
