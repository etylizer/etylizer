%% General Balanced Trees - highly efficient dictionaries.
%%
%% An efficient implementation of Prof. Arne Andersson's General
%% Balanced Trees. These have no storage overhead compared to plain
%% unbalanced binary trees, and their performance is in general better
%% than AVL trees.
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Operations:
%%
%% - empty(): returns empty tree.
%%
%% - is_empty(T): returns 'true' if T is an empty tree, and 'false'
%%   otherwise.
%%
%% - size(T): returns the number of nodes in the tree as an integer.
%%   Returns 0 (zero) if the tree is empty.
%%
%% - lookup(X, T): looks up key X in tree T; returns {value, V}, or
%%   `none' if the key is not present.
%%
%% - get(X, T): retreives the value stored with key X in tree T. Assumes
%%   that the key is present in the tree.
%%
%% - insert(X, V, T): inserts key X with value V into tree T; returns
%%   the new tree. Assumes that the key is *not* present in the tree.
%%
%% - update(X, V, T): updates key X to value V in tree T; returns the
%%   new tree. Assumes that the key is present in the tree.
%%
%% - enter(X, V, T): inserts key X with value V into tree T if the key
%%   is not present in the tree, otherwise updates key X to value V in
%%   T. Returns the new tree.
%%
%% - delete(X, T): removes key X from tree T; returns new tree. Assumes
%%   that the key is present in the tree.
%%
%% - delete_any(X, T): removes key X from tree T if the key is present
%%   in the tree, otherwise does nothing; returns new tree.
%%
%% - take(X, T): removes element with key X from tree T; returns new tree
%%   without removed element. Assumes that the key is present in the tree.
%%
%% - take_any(X, T): removes element with key X from tree T and returns
%%   a new tree if the key is present; otherwise does nothing and returns
%%   'error'.
%%
%% - balance(T): rebalances tree T. Note that this is rarely necessary,
%%   but may be motivated when a large number of entries have been
%%   deleted from the tree without further insertions. Rebalancing could
%%   then be forced in order to minimise lookup times, since deletion
%%   only does not rebalance the tree.
%%
%% - is_defined(X, T): returns `true' if key X is present in tree T, and
%%   `false' otherwise.
%%
%% - keys(T): returns an ordered list of all keys in tree T.
%%
%% - values(T): returns the list of values for all keys in tree T,
%%   sorted by their corresponding keys. Duplicates are not removed.
%%
%% - to_list(T): returns an ordered list of {Key, Value} pairs for all
%%   keys in tree T.
%%
%% - from_orddict(L): turns an ordered list L of {Key, Value} pairs into
%%   a tree. The list must not contain duplicate keys.
%%
%% - smallest(T): returns {X, V}, where X is the smallest key in tree T,
%%   and V is the value associated with X in T. Assumes that the tree T
%%   is nonempty.
%%
%% - largest(T): returns {X, V}, where X is the largest key in tree T,
%%   and V is the value associated with X in T. Assumes that the tree T
%%   is nonempty.
%%
%% - take_smallest(T): returns {X, V, T1}, where X is the smallest key
%%   in tree T, V is the value associated with X in T, and T1 is the
%%   tree T with key X deleted. Assumes that the tree T is nonempty.
%%
%% - take_largest(T): returns {X, V, T1}, where X is the largest key
%%   in tree T, V is the value associated with X in T, and T1 is the
%%   tree T with key X deleted. Assumes that the tree T is nonempty.
%%
%% - smaller(K, T): returns {Key, Value} pair, where Key is the
%%   greatest key strictly less than K, or `none' if no such key exists.
%%
%% - larger(K, T): returns {Key, Value} pair, where Key is the
%%   least key strictly greater than K, or `none' if no such key exists.
%%
%% - iterator(T): returns an iterator that can be used for traversing
%%   the entries of tree T; see `next'. Equivalent to iterator(T, ordered).
%%
%% - iterator(T, Order): returns an iterator that can be used for traversing
%%   the entries of tree T in either ordered or reversed direction; see `next'.
%%   The implementation of this is very efficient; traversing the whole tree
%%   using `next' is only slightly slower than getting the list of all elements
%%   using `to_list' and traversing that. The main advantage of the iterator
%%   approach is that it does not require the complete list of all
%%   elements to be built in memory at one time.
%%
%% - iterator_from(K, T): returns an iterator that can be used for
%%   traversing the entries of tree T with key greater than or
%%   equal to K; see `next'. Equivalent to iterator_from(K, T, ordered).
%%
%% - iterator_from(K, T, Order): returns an iterator that can be used for
%%   traversing the entries of tree T in either ordered or reversed direction,
%%   starting from the key equal to or closest to K; see `next'.
%%
%% - next(S): returns {X, V, S1} where X is the next key referred to
%%   by the iterator S, and S1 is the new iterator to be used for
%%   traversing the remaining entries, or the atom `none' if no entries
%%   remain.
%%
%% - map(F, T): maps the function F(K, V) -> V' to all key-value pairs
%%   of the tree T and returns a new tree T' with the same set of keys
%%   as T and the new set of values V'.

General balanced trees.

This module provides Prof. Arne Andersson's General Balanced Trees. These have
no storage overhead compared to unbalanced binary trees, and their performance
is better than AVL trees.

This module considers two keys as different if and only if they do not compare
equal (`==`).

## Data Structure

Trees and iterators are built using opaque data structures that should not be
pattern-matched from outside this module.

There is no attempt to balance trees after deletions. As deletions do not
increase the height of a tree, this should be OK.

The original balance condition `h(T) <= ceil(c * log(|T|))` has been changed to
the similar (but not quite equivalent) condition `2 ^ h(T) <= |T| ^ c`. This
should also be OK.

%% Data structure:
%% - {Size, Tree}, where `Tree' is composed of nodes of the form:
%%   - {Key, Value, Smaller, Bigger}, and the "empty tree" node:
%%   - nil.
%%
%% I make no attempt to balance trees after deletions. Since deletions
%% don't increase the height of a tree, I figure this is OK.
%%
%% Original balance condition h(T) <= ceil(c * log(|T|)) has been
%% changed to the similar (but not quite equivalent) condition 2 ^ h(T)
%% <= |T| ^ c. I figure this should also be OK.
%%
%% Performance is comparable to the AVL trees in the Erlang book (and
%% faster in general due to less overhead); the difference is that
%% deletion works for my trees, but not for the book's trees. Behaviour
%% is logaritmic (as it should be).
